            <p class="timeline-event">November 17th, 2024: Our first date was at One World Cafe, in Moscow. We spent
                about 4
                hours in there,
                just talking, and getting to know one another. After that, I had a good feeling about us</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">November 30th, 2024: This was the first time we hung out 1-on-1, at my apartment.
                I
                cooked for you, and we watched Luca. This was also the first time we had sex, which I remember really
                enjoying hehe :3</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">December 14th, 2024: This was our first trip together, to Spokane. We went ice
                skating,
                and we spent a bit of time by Spokane Falls, taking pictures together, and enjoying being with each
                other</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">January 1st, 2025 - Roughly 9 PM: You and I became official. I still remember how
                it went. We were on a Discord call, and you were telling me how you were talking with your mom about how
                we were basically dating now. I initially went "Oh, we are?" as a joke, and you got flustered. It was
                cute. But then I said I agreed it was about time we label ourselves, and we spent the next little bit
                deciding on the exact boundaries and labels we were going to use :3</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">April 20th, 2025: This was the first time I met your extended family, at least on
                your mom's side, when I went with you to celebrate Easter. I was able to help cook a meal for your
                family, and enjoy getting to see everyone talk and laugh while eating that food</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">June 29st, 2025: The first time I got to celebrate your birthday with you. I flew
                down to Idaho Falls, and your parents were gracious enough to let me stay with you guys for a week. I
                got to cook for your family, and get to know your family a bit better. It was also a challenging time,
                that ended with us needing a bit of time apart, which was hard for both of us, but I think we're better
                because of it</p>
            <p class="timeline-event">August 15th, 2025: We decided to give things another shot, over a Discord call,
                which feels fitting considering we became official over a Discord call too. I'm so thankful you were
                willing to try things again, and in retrospect, I can see that was the right decision, because you make
                my life brighter every day that you're in it</p>
